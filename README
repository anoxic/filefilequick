a simple file manager


ultimately these are the design goals

* markup should be simple enough over
  the wire that you can use a `curl` interface
* a very thin css and js layer on top
* minimal ajax for speediness with even
  smaller over-the-wire footprint


it should be able to do these things with all files

* open
* delete
* rename
* move
* copy
* share (like file.io)


in addition, these things should be baked in

* search
* tags
* filter by name
* image preview (if tagged)
